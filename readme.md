I have completed this Assignment using Python and for API requests I used requests library.

`Approach:`

I went through the API documentation and I figured out the API urls to which I will use in my assignment. In order to use the API I have to generate the Authorization Keys. In my project there are four sub folders are as follow:

**Config:** It has the two files one is the base.conf file and the other is stage.conf file. Base config will have the configuration which will have the configuration data that will remain same across all users and environment. For example the API urls and some other data.


**Lib:**  It has all the functions which we can reuse in our testcases.
